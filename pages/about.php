        <p>Pixel Owl is a 2D platform game based on the Phaser.js demo tutorial, featuring a simple yet challenging pixel art design. You control an owl whose goal is to collect all the stars scattered across a static map. Each time you collect all the stars, the map resets with new stars and one or more bouncing bombs, which increase in number as you progress.</p>

        <p>Your accumulated score reflects your progress, and at the end of the game, your highest score will be saved to your account for you to beat in future runs.</p>

        <p>Do you have what it takes to collect all the stars and dodge the bombs? Prove your skills and push your limits in Pixel Owl!</p>
